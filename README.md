# PID-Based Arduino Control System

An Arduino-based control system that uses a **PI controller** for distance regulation with ultrasonic sensing, monitors environmental conditions with a **DHT22 sensor**, and adjusts motor operation based on safety thresholds. Real-time feedback is provided through LEDs, an LCD display, and the Serial Monitor.

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **PID control system** in an embedded environment.

* The **mathematical model** of the characteristic equation was derived using engineering mathematics.
* **MATLAB** was used to simulate the PID response and tune controller parameters.
* The tuned values were then implemented into an **Arduino sketch**, compiled into a HEX file, and simulated in **SimulIDE** for validation.

The system combines **control theory, simulation, and embedded programming** to regulate distance and ensure safe operation based on sensor feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Open the `.ino` file in **Arduino IDE**.
3. Install required libraries:

   * `DHT.h` for DHT22
   * `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h` (if using I2C LCD)
4. Compile and upload to your Arduino.
5. (Optional) Export the `.hex` firmware for simulation in **SimulIDE**.

## üöÄ Usage

* Place the ultrasonic sensor in front of the object to measure distance.
* The motor will adjust speed/direction based on the PI controller‚Äôs output.
* If unsafe conditions are detected (e.g., high temperature, unsafe distance), the system triggers LEDs and may shut down the motor.
* Monitor system logs on the Serial Monitor or LCD.

## üß™ Simulation

* Use **MATLAB** to test and tune the PID parameters before deployment.
* Load the Arduino HEX firmware into **SimulIDE** for circuit simulation.

**How To:**
  i. Open SimulIDE.exe
